- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### Continued development

I learnt how to convert Nodelist into Array list with the help of StackOverflow.I also learnt how to use delegation method to target Javascript elements that are displayed after Javascript is run even though i did not implement it on my project as i found a much easier way to do that ...Lastly i learnt how to use forEach() function which was really cool!!
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3199588/fastest-way-to-convert-javascript-nodelist-to-array) - This helped me to learn how to convert a NodeList into an array which was really helpful as i did not know any other way of working with Nodelists
